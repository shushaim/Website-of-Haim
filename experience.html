        <p>I started with my first engineering job while studying toward my B.Sc. degree, working as a co-op student at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurfit-Stone_Container" target="blank">Smurfit-Stone</a> recycled paper plant, where I used AutoCAD to design and draft layouts for steam pipe installations.</p> 
        <p>During my last semester at UNF, I started interning at Riley Gear, which specializes in design and manufacturing of gears and transmition systems; and, upon graduating, I accepted a full time engineering position, working for the VP of sales.</p>
        <p>My main project at Riley Gear was the creation and maintenance of a 3D model library of manufactured gears, using the Pro/Engineer 3D modeling package. I was also a detrimental member of a small team that designed a new gearbox for an off-shore drilling turbine.</p>
        <p>Looking to expend my experience, I left Riley Gear and accepted a job as a Quality Manager with the Signal Solution unit of Siemens' Rail Automation division.</p>
        <p>We are the ones that make sure trains don't run into each other, don't run over your car, and, in general, are beeing able to communicate effectively with their dispatcher.</p>
        <p>One of my "babies" in this role was the creation of a spreadsheet tool to calculate and assign quality grades to our engineers, based on their experience, the complexity of the project they work on, and the number of errors they make in three distinct categories (details, functional, and critical).</p>
        <p>~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~</p>
        <p>And while all of that was going on, I assisted my wife with the creation of her uber-successful company - <a href="http://improveffect.com" target="blank">The Improv Effect</a>.</p>
        <p>I created a set of specialized tools to run the company's accounting, invoicing, and forecasting systems; and am still using it today (or, more accurately, an upgraded revision of the original set).</p>
        <p>I am also running the logistics and legal aspects of the business.</p>
